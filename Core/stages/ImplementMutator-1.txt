Assist me in implementing the mutator named {{mutator.name}}. Below is the description of its functionality:
{{mutator.desc}}

You can utilize below's two example implementation as a reference:

Example implementation for mutator ChangeDeclRef.
```cpp
// ChangeDeclRef.cpp
{% include 'notes/ChangeDeclRef.cpp' %}
```

Example implementation for mutator ChangeBinop.
```cpp
// ChangeBinop.cpp
{% include 'notes/ChangeBinop.cpp' %}
```

Consider using the following APIs for easier implementation:
```
{% include 'notes/APIs.txt' %}
```

{% include 'notes/ImplNotes.txt' %}
