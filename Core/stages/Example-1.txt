Assist me in identifying test cases that can effectively apply the mutator named {{mutator.name}}.

**Important Guidelines**
- Each test case should be presented in a separate code block.
- Each test case should be a complete, compilable, runnable program.
- Please use only C features
- Your example better contain rich types such as struct union pointer array function-pointer, etc
